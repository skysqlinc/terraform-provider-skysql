#
# Step 2: Add config_id to the service resource block.
#
# Step 3: Run terraform plan / apply.
#   Terraform will detect that config_id changed from empty to the new config ID
#   and apply it to the service.
#
# Day 2 operations:
#   - Change config_id to a different config → applies the new config.
#   - Remove config_id from the resource block → reverts to the default config.

# Example 3: Share a single configuration across multiple services
#
# A config can be referenced by multiple services. When you change values
# in the config, ALL services using it are automatically reconfigured.
#
# Important:
#   - You cannot delete a config that is assigned to any service.
#     Terraform handles this automatically — it removes config_id from
#     services before destroying the config resource.
#   - Changing values in a shared config triggers a rolling reconfiguration
#     on every service that references it.
